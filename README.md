# 01. Inbox
Here I store short notes that acts as reminders of ideas, a sort of bookmark for things that I want to extract knowledge from.

Consider these points before choosing to save a note:
1. Is this something I will care about in one year?
1. Is this something I can make use of?

If the answer is no to both, it's most likely not something I'll want to save.

# 02. References
On a daily basis, I'll go to the **inbox** and pick out the ideas that I really want to keep.
Look for the ones that still interests me, and then the next step is to elaborate those notes into a paragraph that describes the idea in full.

1. Write it in my own words
1. Write it in such away that if I read it 10 years later, it would make complete sense by itself  
1. Include the complete reference for the source I got the idea from. 
1. Include the relevant citation (lastName, year, pp.22).

# 03. Permanent notes
Some differences between **reference notes** and **Permanent notes**:

-   **Reference notes** are written in the context of the source they were inspired by
	-   Whereas **permanent notes** are written in the context of my own ideas and interests.
-   **Reference notes** only have one connection, to the book they came from.
	-  Whereas **permanent notes** can have many connections (to individual notes, as part of multiple topics etc)
- **Each note represents a single idea** ( [[03 - Permanent notes/Atomic Note|Atomic Notes]] ). 
	- If I need to define a term for the idea/concept to make sense, I'll make a new note for the term and link to it from this note

## Map of Contents
#MOC ( [[Map of Content]] ) serve the purpose of collecting various single ideas into a shared context, so for ideas that are complex (i.e. built upon multiple ideas) I can use a [[Map of Content]]  to sort/categorize the various ideas.
Since single ideas could be relevant for multiple complex ideas, multiple [[Map of Content|Map of Contents]] could reference the same notes.
In fact, it might even be relevant to link to other [[Map of Content|Map of Contents]] for complex ideas that are based upon multiple complex ideas.

# 04. Projects
Projects is where I store notes for specific projects where I'm trying to produce something(s).
It could be anything from a blog-post, a family gathering to developing an application.
Each project-note could link to notes found in the other folders, but they could just as well be self-contained notes.
For any piece of knowledge or idea that could be re-used, I'll store it as a **permanent note** and link to it.

# General guidelines
For this setup to really shine, use the following tips:
- **Refrain from creating folders** *(use less than you're comfortable with)*
	- **Reduces the risk** of using a piece of knowledge in only one context
- **Be liberal with links and tags** *(use more than you're comfortable with)*
	- **Increases the use** of each piece of knowledge I gain in multiple contexts/disciplines
