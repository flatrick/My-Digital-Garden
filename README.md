# 01 Inbox
Here I store short notes that acts as reminders of ideas, a sort of bookmark for things that I want to extract knowledge from.

Consider these points before choosing to save a note:
1. Is this something that inspires me?
2. Is this something I will care about in one year?
4. Is this something I can make use of?
5. Is this an insight of mine from hard-won knowledge worth revisiting?
6. Is this something I'm unlikely to find easily in the future?

If the answer is yes to any one of them, it is worth saving.

# 02 References
On a daily basis, I'll go to the **01 Inbox** and pick out the ideas that I really want to keep.
I'll look for the ones that still interests me, and then the next step is to elaborate those notes into a paragraph that describes the idea in full.
If I find notes that I don't see a use for long term, nor interesting enough to expand upon, I'll remove them completely.

1. Write it in my own words
1. Write it in such away that if I read it 10 years later, it would make complete sense by itself  
1. Include the complete reference for the source I got the idea from. 
1. Include the relevant citation (lastName, year, pp.22).

When I'm done turning the note in **inbox** into a **reference note**, I'll remove the note from the inbox.

# 03 Permanent notes
Here is where I store my own thoughts, either distilled from various notes found in **02 References**,  **03 Permanent notes** or just straight from my own mind.
This is also where I keep my [[Map of Content]] to navigate my various categories.

Some key differences between **Reference notes** and **Permanent notes**:
-   **Reference notes** are written in the context of the source they were inspired by
	-   Whereas **Permanent notes** are written in the context of my own ideas and interests
-   **Reference notes** should only have one connection: the source they came from
	-  Whereas **Permanent notes** can have many connections to other **Permanent notes** or **Reference notes**
- **Each Permanent Note represents a single idea** ( [[Atomic Note]] ). 

# 04 Projects
Projects is where I store notes for specific projects where I'm trying to produce something(s).
It could be anything from a blog-post, a family gathering to developing an application.
Each project-note could link to notes found in the other folders, but they could just as well be self-contained notes.
For any piece of knowledge or idea that could be re-used, I'll store it as a **permanent note** and link to it.

# General guidelines
For this setup to really shine, use the following tips:
- **Refrain from creating folders** *(use less than you're comfortable with)*
	- **Reduces the risk** of using a piece of knowledge in only one context
- **Be liberal with links and tags** *(use more than you're comfortable with)*
	- **Increases the use** of each piece of knowledge I gain in multiple contexts/disciplines
