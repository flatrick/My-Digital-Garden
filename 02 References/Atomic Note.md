# Atomic Note
An [[Atomic Note]] is a note of a single thought/idea.

Consider these points when making a note:
* Why is it important to me? 
* What are potential upsides to it?
* What are potential downsides to it?
* What is this related to?

## Why?
When we don't restrict ourselves to **One Idea Per Note**, we run the risk of writing about loosely related topics that "muddles" the main goal of the note.

Those related topics also might never get described in-depth because of this, leaving potential holes in our understanding when we revisit the note in the future.

By restricting ourselves to one idea per note, we're able to use our knowledge and thoughts like pieces of lego to build multiple things from the same pieces.
