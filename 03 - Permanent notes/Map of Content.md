## Map of Content
A #MOC ( *Map of Content* ) serve the purpose of collecting various single ideas into a shared context, so for ideas that are complex (i.e. built upon multiple ideas) I can use a [[Map of Content]]  to sort/categorize the various ideas.

Since single ideas could be relevant for multiple complex ideas, multiple [[Map of Content|Map of Contents]] could reference the same notes.
In fact, it might even be relevant to link to other [[Map of Content|Map of Contents]] for complex ideas that are based upon multiple complex ideas.
